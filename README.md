# S.M.A.R.T. (Sharing Management Archive & Retrieval Tool)

Knowledge management's primary role is to share knowledge throughout the organization such that each individual of the organization understands more at an in-depth level. Knowledge management applications are essential building blocks for having important information at the ready. Being able to find records inside a company is not always easy. There are many company intranets for making information available, but that does not mean items are searchable. Accessing information often depends on users knowing where something is located â€“ or knowing who can find it. One of the best knowledge management applications is a vital record keeping and retrieval search engine that can tell users where the content is located digitally and/or physically.
